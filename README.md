- Vanilla javaScript

### What I learned

I leaned a lot with this project. I wanted to make the answers fade-in and out and I wasn't sure how to do that.
I used chatGPT to learn that, and had a lot of follow-up questions. It's important to me to not just -
get the solutions from chatGPT, but to really anderstand how things works.
One of the greatest thing about chatGPT is that you can ask about every little code line, why and how and why not something else. frontend mentor is as close as I can get to have a real job experience, but its a lonely one. chatGPT is having a coworker that is much more advenced than you and willing to help.
I leatn a lot about the differences between getElementByClassName and querySelectorAll,
the nextElementSibling (which I haven't use eventually), scrollHeight and more.

I really fill that this chalange gave me alot.
